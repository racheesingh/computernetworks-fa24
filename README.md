# Introduction to Computer Networks
This undergraduate-level course will cover the key principles of computer networking that underlie the design and operation of the Internet. The course will
explore both the communication protocols used by the core components of the Internet (e.g., routing,
forwarding) and those utilized at the endpoints of the network (e.g., congestion control, domain
name system). The course will provide a primer on the information-theoretic principles that
govern transfer of bits on physical media between network nodes. Finally, this course will teach
students how computer networks have evolved to accommodate a growing number of Internet users and applications, including
the rise of cloud computing, warehouse-scale datacenters etc.

# Logistics of the course
The class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays in Hollister Hall B14 from 2.55 PM to 4.10 PM.
