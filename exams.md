We will have three exams in this course. Two preliminary exams (Prelim 1 and 2) will be during the lecture slot (2.55 PM to 4.10 PM). The final exam will be during the finals
period of the semester. All exams will have very short answer questions, including but not limited to multiple choice questions. Exams are open notes.
You are allowed to bring a fixed number of pages (printed or handwritten) to the exam. You are not allowed any electronic devices during the exam (laptops, tablets, phones).
